#note - 
Mesh terms are labels assigned to blocks of scientific texts used to describe what the paper is about, allowing automated indexing for scientific literature.

this was a script I wrote during my time working for Thomson Reuter's IP&Science Department (before they were sold to onyx and baring). For one client we needed to identify mesh terms for a large number of abstracts (1000+) - leverageing python, beautiful soup and other libraries, I made a bot to automatically search this data for us. 

The code wasn't gorgeous, but it got the job done!
